            <p> My first ever project was a remote-controlled car built with a Raspberry Pi that I worked on with my dad. 
                Since then, I have worked on several projects, utilizing tools such as microcontrollers, 3D printers, and Fusion 360.<br><br>
            My most recent project is actually this page! I decided to learn more about front-end development, and decided to make a portfolio
            for myself as my first project. This website is built using HMTL, CSS, and Javascript. The purpose of this website is primarily to 
            serve as a way for me to document and show my projects to the world. Here are some more of my projects:</p>

                <p class = "code"> Arduino Uno, 3D Design and Printing, C++, Circuits</p>
                <p class = "paragraph">I made a projectile launcher that is capable of launching a projectile up to five feet forwards and two feet upwards with an adjustable 
                    angle that is controlled by an Arduino Uno. The stepper motor used was powered by an external power supply. <br><br> The angle is accurate to half a degree, though could have been made more accurate with more precise 
                    hardware. When tested, the projectile launched using the launcher landed within a few inches where predicted, which was remarkably accurate.<br><br>The 
                    launcher itself is 3D printed, and all of the files used were made in Fusion 360.</p>

                <p class = "paragraph">I made this locker camera to document my senior year. The camera is an Arducam 5 attached to a Raspberry Pi. 
                    A battery bank inside the locker powered the Pi. <br><br> The Pi would start recording whenever the PIR sensor picked up motion (when the 
                    locker was opened). The Pi would stop and save the recording when the locker was closed. The recordings would get saved and exported 
                    off of the SD card later since the Pi's GPU was slower at encoding than my computer. <br><br> Overall, the project taught me a lot about 
                    electronics and their behaviour, alongside video encoding and the computing power of microcontrollers.</p>

                <p class = "paragraph">In 2022, I built a multi-GPU rig setup for validating transactions on the Ethereum blockchain (mining). <br><br> 
                    The rig primarily used GPUs to perform mathematical processes to validate transactions on the Ethereum network. For each validated transactions done by the rig, the network would pay the rig a small fee in return. <br><br> The computer rig was carefully 
                    overclocked to ensure best performance while maintaining the longevity of the components. <br><br>The rig was configured on the network
                    to be accessible remotely for features such as remote reset and changing performance settings, such as the fan speeds and overclock settings.
