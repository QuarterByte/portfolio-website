This is a portfolio website that I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website contains a Home and Projects section, with a navigation bar to traverse the sections and additionally provides my socials.

The purpose behind the development of this website was to have a place that shows my projects and passions in an organized and visually appealing way. Additionally, the project deepened my HTML/CSS and JS knowledge.
