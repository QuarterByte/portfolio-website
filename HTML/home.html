            <h1 id = "about-me">About Me</h1>
            <p>I am currently an undergraduate Computer Engineering student, studying at the University of Toronto. I would describe myself as ambitious, curious, and highly driven;
                I want to see my work have a positive impact on the world.
                <br><br> Growing up, I was surrounded by technology. My dad was a computer engineer, and I would 
                often shadow him and ask him a hundred questions about what he is working on, to which he would patiently answer. I loved tinkering with whatever tech I got my hands on, 
                whether it was a Wii, a laptop, or an iPad. I have always had a deep curiosity for technology, and that stays true to this day.
                <br><br>I started my coding journey in the sixth grade, when i recieved a Raspberry Pi 3B+ as a gift. One of my first projects was a SSH-controlled toy car; I coded
                inputs that would control the motors on the car, thereby making the car move forwards, backwards, and to the left and right. This project really opened my eyes to the creative
                pathways that technology provides, and It only made me love technology more. Since then I have developed several projects, involving whatever tools I found interesting and I
                 wanted to learn more about.
                <br><br>I have experience with a variety of code, software, and hardware. I am proficient in languages such as Python, 
                C, C++, HTML/CSS, and the 5 love languages. Additionally, I am confident in building electrical circuits involving basic electronic components 
                (capacitors, transistors), logic gates, etc. Lastly, I have a diverse background of experience with software, ranging from Virtual Machines to 3D design software
                to the adobe suite (photoshop, premiere pro etc.). In my past projects, I have consistentlty used these tools to build something that I find to be creative, useful, and fun.
